<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<h4>Last updated / Effective date:<br>March 13, 2021</h4>


<p>By using this app (Drug Names), you are consenting to the policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information set out in this privacy policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use this app.</p>

<h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>

<p> This app gives you the option to contact us, as well as the option to include your email if you would like to hear back. Otherwise, I, Larry Nguyen, do not collect or share any information, personal or otherwise. The app utilizes a framework created and maintained by Apple, called Core Data, to manage the data (such as recording correct/incorrect answers, timestamps of when a question or set is complete, favorited drugs, and custom hints) needed to track and present the user’s progress and improve their experience. This data is stored on your device and is not accessible by myself. That said, it is strongly advised that personal or sensitive information NOT be stored as custom hints.  No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>If you wish to contact the developer, this app uses a third-party website (TypeForm) as a convenient way to do so in-app. Communication between the app and TypeForm occurs over HTTPs. I am not affiliated with Typeform. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of their website. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Using TypeForm is optional, and users may choose to email the developer directly at larryn.dev@gmail.com if they have any questions, concerns, or comments.</p>

<p>If you email the developer for support or other feedback, through TypeForm or directly, the emails with email addresses will be retained for quality assurance purposes. The email addresses will be used only to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any marketing purpose.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>

<p>I will not disclose your information to any third party except if you expressly consent or where required by law.</p>

<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

<p>This app is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>


<p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

<h3>Contacting Me</h3>

<p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you can email me at <a
